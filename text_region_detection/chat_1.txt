What is the state of art classical way of detecting text regions in document images. If possible share python code as well

Model:
The state-of-the-art classical (non-deep learning) method for detecting text regions in document images typically involves a combination of the following steps:

🏛️ Classical Pipeline (State-of-the-Art Non-Deep Method)
Grayscale conversion

Noise reduction (optional)

Morphological operations (like dilation/erosion)

Edge or gradient-based detection

Connected component analysis or Contour detection

Heuristic filtering (aspect ratio, size, area, etc.)

This approach works well for clean documents and is relatively fast and lightweight compared to deep learning methods.

✅ Python Code using OpenCV
Below is a well-tuned classical method using morphological gradient and contour analysis, particularly effective for detecting blocks of text:

python
Copy
Edit
import cv2
import numpy as np

def detect_text_regions(image_path):
    # Load image and convert to grayscale
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Apply morphological gradient (blackhat or gradient works well for text)
    morph_kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (15, 3))
    grad = cv2.morphologyEx(gray, cv2.MORPH_GRADIENT, morph_kernel)

    # Binarize using Otsu's method
    _, binary = cv2.threshold(grad, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)

    # Connect horizontally oriented regions
    connect_kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (25, 1))
    connected = cv2.morphologyEx(binary, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, connect_kernel)

    # Find contours and filter them
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(connected, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    output = img.copy()

    for cnt in contours:
        x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(cnt)
        aspect_ratio = w / float(h)
        area = cv2.contourArea(cnt)

        # Filter based on size and shape
        if area > 100 and 1 < aspect_ratio < 15:
            cv2.rectangle(output, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    return output

# Example usage
output_img = detect_text_regions('path_to_document.jpg')
cv2.imshow("Detected Text Regions", output_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
🔍 Notes:
cv2.MORPH_GRADIENT and cv2.MORPH_BLACKHAT are powerful for highlighting text edges.

cv2.findContours() works well for connected components.

Adjust morph_kernel and connect_kernel sizes depending on font size/density.

📌 When to Use Classical Method:
Works well for scanned documents or printed text.

Suitable for resource-constrained environments (no GPU).

Faster than deep learning models for basic document OCR preprocessing.

Let me know if you want a mask output (text = white, background = black) instead of rectangles!
